GENUINO SOLIDITY TASK - Senior
Build a vanity name registering system.
The purpose of the name is outside the scope of the assignment and you can make
reasonable assumptions on the size, encoding, etc of the name to complete in time.
An unregistered name can be registered for a certain amount of time by locking a certain
balance of an account. After the registration expires, the account loses ownership of the
name and his balance is unlocked. The registration can be renewed by making an on-chain
call to keep the name registered and balance locked.
You can assume reasonable defaults for the locking amount and period.
The fee to register the name depends directly on the size of the name.
In this task it is not required to make the system resistant against frontrunning or malicious
node/validators.
Test cases and Deploy on a testnet is required.
